# HW 03

This is a JSON file I/O test program.
We assess water quality from example turbidity measurements stored in a JSON file located ![here]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjallen/turbidity/main/turbidity_data.json").

The input data has the following format:

```
{
  "turbidity_data": [
   {
     "datetime": "2022-02-01 00:00",
     "sample_volume": 1.19,
     "calibration_constant": 1.022,
     "detector_current": 1.137,
     "analyzed_by": "C. Milligan"
   },
   {
     "datetime": "2022-02-01 01:00",
     "sample_volume": 1.15,
     "calibration_constant": 0.975,
     "detector_current": 1.141,
     "analyzed_by": "C. Milligan"
   },
 ... etc
```

- .gitignore: ignores any downloaded .json files
- water.py	: calculate and print current water status and minimum required treatment time using a moving average window of 5 samples.
  -  We calculate turbidity via the following equation    
 ```
 T = a0 * I90
 T = Turbidity in NTU Units (0 â€“ 40)
 a0 = Calibration constant
 I90 = Ninety degree detector current
 ```
  -  We calculate minimum required time for safe water via the following inequality  
 ```
 Ts > T0(1-d)**b
 Ts = Turbidity threshold for safe water
 T0 = Current turbidity
 d = decay factor per hour, expressed as a decimal
 b = hours elapsed
 ```
- test_water.py	: tests the water program functions.

## Run (via terminal):

Linux	: `python3 water.py` and/or `python3 test_water.py`  
Windows	: `py water.py` and/or `py test_water.py`

- If you do not have `wget` on your system, the JSON file linked above must be downloaded to `turbidity_data.json` in the same directory. (`Right-Click` and `Save As`).  
Otherwise, the program will autodownload the file.  

## Example Output

water.py:  
```
Average turbidity based on most recent five measurements = 1.1544952000000002 NTU
WARNING:root:Turbidity is above threshold for safe use
Minimum time required to return below a safe threshold = 7.111086148101843 hours
```
- If you have safe water, the program may output a message like the below:  
```
Average turbidity based on most recent five measurements = 0.9852 NTU
Info: Turbidity is below threshold for safe use
Minimum time required to return below a safe threshold = 0 hours
```

TESTER:  
```
<function tests.test_current at 0x7f9d79669268>
<function tests.test_read at 0x7f9d796692f0>
<function tests.test_sort at 0x7f9d796691e0>

CRITICAL:root:Nonphysical Decay Constant...
Exit
CRITICAL:root:Nonphysical Decay Constant...
Exit
<function tests.test_turbid at 0x7f9d796690d0>
```
- Any tester output without an `AssertionError` is valid.

Please note this program only supports Python3, so the Windows command depends on your installation and aliases.
